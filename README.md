# Conference Carbon Footprint Analysis

This project analyzes the carbon footprint of a major conference and estimates the potential reduction in CO2 emissions by switching from a monocentric to a multicentric format.

## Project Workflow

The analysis is performed through a series of R scripts located in the `R/` directory. The general workflow is as follows:

1.  **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Attendee data from past conferences is loaded, cleaned, and standardized. This includes correcting location names and merging synonyms.
2.  **Geocoding**: The cleaned location data is converted into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude).
3.  **Carbon Footprint Calculation**:
    *   The carbon footprint is calculated for the traditional **monocentric** model, where all attendees travel to a single location.
    *   The footprint is then calculated for a hypothetical **multicentric** model, where the conference is held simultaneously in multiple locations to reduce travel distances.
4.  **Analysis and Reporting**: The results from the monocentric and multicentric models are compared to estimate the potential CO2 savings. The project also analyzes the "attraction power" of different conference locations.

## Repository Structure

-   `CarbonFootprint.Rproj`: RStudio project file.
-   `README.md`: This file.
-   `R/`: Contains the R scripts that perform the analysis.
    -   `01_data_loading.R`: Loads raw attendee data.
    -   `02_collect_synonyms.R`: Cleans and standardizes location data.
    -   `03_geocode.R`: Geocodes attendee locations.
    -   `04_all_attendees_maps.R`: Generates maps of attendee distribution.
    -   `05_monocentric_footprint.R`: Calculates the carbon footprint for a single-site conference.
    -   `06_multicentric_footprint.R`: Calculates the carbon footprint for a multi-site conference.
    -   `07_multicentric_benchmark.R`: Compares the multicentric model against a benchmark.
    -   `08_attraction_power.R`: Analyzes the regional draw of conference hubs.
    -   `utils.R`: Utility functions used by other scripts.
-   `data/`: Contains input data.
    -   `location_synonyms.csv`: A list of location names to be treated as synonyms during cleaning.
-   `output/`: Contains intermediate and final data files, figures, and reports generated by the R scripts.
-   `renv/`: R environment management folder.

## How to Run

1.  Open the `CarbonFootprint.Rproj` file in RStudio.
2.  Make sure you have the necessary packages installed. The `renv` package is used for managing dependencies.
3.  Run the scripts in the `R/` directory in numerical order.

This analysis provides a quantitative framework for assessing the environmental impact of large-scale academic events and offers a data-driven approach to exploring more sustainable alternatives.
